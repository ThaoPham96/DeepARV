# DeepARV: Ensemble Deep Learning to Predict Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) of Clinical Relevance with Antiretroviral Therapy

Due to the importance of DDIs throughout drug development and for the clinical management of people living with HIV, efficient computational methods for predicting DDI risks are in need. We propose a deep learning approach called DeepARV that builds on the University of Liverpool HIV Drug Interaction database (https://www.hiv-druginteractions.org/) to predict the risk of DDIs between ARVs and commonly used comedications using the concept of molecular drug structural similarity.
